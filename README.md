# Particles

### This project was made to combine WebGL and Web Assembly abilities to make a scene with big amount of elements

- WebGl to make a scene
- Used Rust with WebAssebly to calculate particle positions
- Used my [typescript boilerplate](https://github.com/yankuchinsky/typescript-boilerplate) in this project
